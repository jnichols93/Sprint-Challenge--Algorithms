'''
Your function should take in a single parameter (a string `word`)
Your function should return a count of how many occurences of ***"th"*** occur within `word`. Case matters.
Your function must utilize recursion. It cannot contain any loops.
'''
def count_th(word):
    # baseCase
    # if word is to short return 0
    if len(word) < 2:
        return 0
    # if the first two letters are 'th', return 1+ recursive search at index 
    if word[0] == 't' and word[1] == 'h':
        return 1+ count_th(word[1:])
    # otherwise return recursive search at index to the right of 1
    else:
        return count_th(word[1:])
    # return the count
    return(count_th)
