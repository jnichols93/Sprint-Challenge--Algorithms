#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)  Linear- O(n): This is linear because n is a constant variable.


b) Quadratic - 0(n^2): due to the nested for loops, Quadratic due to n being given a range. 


c) Linear - O(n): This is Linear becaause bunnies is a set #, so despite a recursive call bunnies goes down in line to base
